This is a honeypot based on a weak credential vulnerability. 

I have not imported the monitoring script yet. 

So for the moment it is just a docker environment with ssh and an interactive shell. 

The goal of this honeypot was to analyse malware that were upload on it and also analyse all the command of the attacker with a bash history.
